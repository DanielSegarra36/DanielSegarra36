### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel and I am a software engineer and educator.

I've spent the last three years teaching introductory web development skills, through non-profit development courses, in traditional and non-traditional tech environments, to promote interdisciplinary solutions while strengthening existing and complementary skills.
